# **Problem Statement:2 Cognitive Radiology Report Generation**
#### <div align="right">🎯 Marks: 60</div>

#### 📌 The Challenge:
In the high-pressure environment of a radiology reading room, "reader fatigue" leads to a 3-5% discrepancy rate in human-generated reports. Your task is to develop a **Deep Learning Framework** that acts as a "Second Reader"—an AI capable of automating the drafting of radiology reports.

Participants must build a model that:
1.  **Ingests:** Chest X-Ray (CXR) images (PA/Lateral views) and Clinical Indication text (e.g., *"55M with fever"*).
2.  **Processes:** Aligns visual features with medical ontology (RadLex) and mimics clinical reasoning.
3.  **Outputs:** A structured, clinically accurate text report comprising **Findings** and **Impression** sections.

**The Core Innovation:**
To win, your solution must move beyond standard black-box transformers. You must demonstrate **"Cognitive Simulation"** inspired by the **Hi-CliTr** framework, implementing:
* **Hierarchical Visual Perception (PRO-FA)**
* **Knowledge-Enhanced Classification (MIX-MLP)**
* **Triangular Cognitive Attention (RCTA)**

#### 📂 Dataset Specifications:
You will utilize two primary datasets. **MIMIC-CXR** is the gold standard for training, while **IU-Xray** is used for benchmarking domain generalization.

1.  **MIMIC-CXR (Primary Training Data)** ()
2.  **IU-Xray (Benchmarking Data)** ([Kaggle Mirror](https://www.kaggle.com/raddar/chest-xrays-indiana-university) or OpenI)

#### 📊 Data Field Description:

**A. MIMIC-CXR Structure**
The dataset contains 377,110 images corresponding to 227,835 radiographic studies.
```json
{
  "subject_id": "Patient identifier (Unique per patient)",
  "study_id": "Examination identifier (Target reports are linked to this)",
  "dicom_id": "Image identifier (Specific to a single X-ray view)",
  "text": "The full free-text radiology report (Target)",
  "ViewPosition": "PA (Posterior-Anterior) or LATERAL"
}

```

**B. IU-Xray Structure (`indiana_projections.csv` & `indiana_reports.csv`)**
A smaller, open-access dataset for testing robustness.

```json
{
  "uid": "Unique Report ID (Foreign Key for merging)",
  "filename": "Name of the image file (e.g., 1_IM-0001-4001.dcm.png)",
  "projection": "View position (Frontal/Lateral)",
  "findings": "Target Output 1: Detailed observations of the scan",
  "impression": "Target Output 2: Summary diagnosis",
  "indication": "Input Feature: Patient symptoms/history (Context)",
  "MeSH": "Medical Subject Headings (useful for label classification)"
}

```

### 🛠 Technical Requirements (Mandatory Architecture)

To solve issues of "hallucination" and lack of interpretability, your submission **must** implement the following three architectural concepts.

#### 1. Module 1: Hierarchical Visual Alignment (PRO-FA)

* **Logic:** A radiologist analyzes images at different scales: Whole Organ (Heart), Region (Lobe), and Pixel (Lesion).
* **Requirement:** Your visual encoder (e.g., ViT) must extract features at three distinct granularities: **Pixel-level, Region-level, and Organ-level**.
* **Constraint:** Use **RadLex embeddings** to align these visual features with medical text (e.g., ensuring the model knows what a "Lung" looks like).

#### 2. Module 2: Knowledge-Enhanced Classification (MIX-MLP)

* **Logic:** Before writing, a doctor forms a "mental diagnosis" (e.g., "Positive for Pneumonia").
* **Requirement:** Implement a multi-label classification branch that predicts disease tags (using **CheXpert**) before generating text.
* **Constraint:** Use a **Multi-path MLP** (Residual Path + Expansion Path) to model disease co-occurrence and handle noisy labels.

#### 3. Module 3: Triangular Cognitive Attention (RCTA)

* **Logic:** Doctors use a verification loop: Look at Image  Check History  Form Hypothesis  Verify with Image.
* **Requirement:** Implement a triangular attention mechanism:
1. **Image queries Clinical Text**  Creates Context.
2. **Context queries Predicted Labels**  Creates Hypothesis.
3. **Hypothesis queries Image (again)**  Verification (Closed Loop).


### 🔔 **Important Notes:**
- **Dates:** February 6th - 8th, 2026.
- **Submission Portal:** [Unstop](https://unstop.com/) (All registrations and final submissions must be made here).
- **Evaluation:** Solutions are judged on **Clinical Efficiency (CE)** and **Semantic Structure**, not just text similarity.
- **Strict Constraint:** Simple Encoder-Decoder models (image captioning) will be penalized. You must implement the **Cognitive Modules** described below.

### 📊 Performance Metrics

Your solution will be evaluated on a hidden test set based on **Natural Language Generation (NLG)** quality and **Clinical Efficiency (CE)**.

| Metric Category | Metrics Used | Weight | Description | Target Benchmark |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| **Clinical Accuracy** | **CheXpert F1** | **40%** | Does the report diagnose the correct diseases? (Precision/Recall on 14 pathologies). | **F1 > 0.500** |
| **Structural Logic** | **RadGraph F1** | **30%** | Does the model correctly link entities? (e.g., *"Pneumonia"* is `located_at` *"Left Lower Lobe"*). | **Relations > 0.500** |
| **NLG Fluency** | **CIDEr, BLEU-4** | **30%** | Is the text readable, grammatically correct, and capturing rare words? | **CIDEr > 0.400** |

### 💻 Environment & Tools

* **Platform:** Google Colab Pro / Local GPU Cluster (Mixed Precision Training Recommended).
* **Frameworks:** PyTorch, TensorFlow.
* **Required Libraries:** `transformers` (Hugging Face), `chexpert-labeler`, `radgraph`.
* **Docker:** All submissions must be containerized for reproducibility.
